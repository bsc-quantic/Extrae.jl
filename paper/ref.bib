abstract = {Cutting-edge functionalities in embedded systems require the use of parallel architectures to meet their performance requirements. This imposes the introduction of a new layer in the software stacks of embedded systems: the parallel programming model. Unfortunately, the tools used to analyze embedded systems fall short to characterize the performance of parallel applications at a parallel programming model level, and correlate this with information about non-functional requirements such as real-time, energy, memory usage, etc. HPC tools, like Extrae, are designed with that level of abstraction in mind, but their main focus is on performance evaluation. Overall, providing insightful information about the performance of parallel embedded applications at the parallel programming model level, and relate it to the non-functional requirements, is of paramount importance to fully exploit the performance capabilities of parallel embedded architectures. This paper contributes to the state-of-the-art of analysis tools for embedded systems by: (1) analyzing the particular constraints of embedded systems compared to HPC systems (e.g., static setting, restricted memory, limited drivers) to support HPC analysis tools; (2) porting Extrae, a powerful tracing tool from the HPC domain, to the GR740 platform, a SoC used in the space domain; and (3) augmenting Extrae with new features needed to correlate the parallel execution with the following non-functional requirements: energy, temperature and memory usage. Finally, the paper presents the usefulness of Extrae to characterize OpenMP applications and its non-functional requirements, evaluating different aspects of the applications running in the GR740.},

abstract = {The diverse landscape of distributed heterogeneous computer systems currently available and being created to address computational challenges with the highest performance requirements presents daunting complexity for application developers. They must effectively decompose and distribute their application functionality and data, efficiently orchestrating the associated communication and synchronisation, on multi/manycore CPU processors with multiple attached acceleration devices structured within compute nodes with interconnection networks of various topologies. Sophisticated compilers, runtime systems and libraries are (loosely) matched with debugging, performance measurement and analysis tools, with proprietary versions by integrators/vendors provided exclusively for their systems complemented by portable (primarily) open-source equivalents developed and supported by the international research community over many years. The Scalasca and Paraver toolsets are two widely employed examples of the latter, installed on personal notebook computers through to the largest leadership HPC systems. Over more than fifteen years their developers have worked closely together in numerous collaborative projects culminating in the creation of a universal parallel performance assessment and optimisation methodology focused on application execution efficiency and scalability, and the associated training and coaching of application developers (often in teams) in its productive use, reviewed in this article with lessons learnt therefrom.}
